However, there are use cases where, the ability to create a multi node cluster or spin up multiple clusters with flexibilty to switch between clusters is required. Eventhough Rancher Desktop doesn\'t have in-built multi node/cluster functionality, you can use k3d with Rancher Desktop to accomplish the same. k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (a minimal Kubernetes distribution, which is used by Rancher Desktop as well) in docker. k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"how-to-guides/hello-world-example":{"id":"how-to-guides/hello-world-example","title":"Hello World Example","description":"This tutorial will demonstrate how to get started with Rancher Desktop by pushing an app to a local Kubernetes cluster.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"how-to-guides/increasing-open-file-limit":{"id":"how-to-guides/increasing-open-file-limit","title":"Increasing Open File Limit","description":"You may wish to increase the open file limit as Rancher Desktop\'s default ulimit setting for pods may be too low, depending on your use case.

Rancher Desktop is not Rancher on the Desktop. Rancher is a powerful solution to manage Kubernetes clusters. Rancher Desktop runs local Kubernetes and a container management platform. The two solutions complement each other. For example, you can install Rancher as a workload in Rancher Desktop.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"how-to-guides/running-air-gapped":{"id":"how-to-guides/running-air-gapped","title":"Running When Offline","description":"Rancher Desktop can be run when offline, aka in air-gapped mode.

Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your application, and it provides building blocks for creating CI/CD pipelines. This enables you to focus on iterating on your application locally while Skaffold continuously deploys to your local or remote Kubernetes cluster. To learn more about Skaffold, refer to the project docs here.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"how-to-guides/vs-code-docker":{"id":"how-to-guides/vs-code-docker","title":"Debugging a Container App with VS Code Docker extension","description":"The VS Code Docker extension makes it easy to build, manage, debug and deploy containerized applications in Visual Studio Code.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"how-to-guides/vs-code-remote-containers":{"id":"how-to-guides/vs-code-remote-containers","title":"VS Code Remote Containers","description":"The [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers] extension lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment, which helps ensure a consistent environment across developer machines and makes it easy for new team members and contributors to get up and running.
